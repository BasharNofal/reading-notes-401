# Hash Tables

**Hash tables** are another way to store data in the memory, they are similar to arrays but they are much more efficient.

**Hash tables** are similar to arrays where you can store key/value pair in each index, but to search for a certain value you will only need the key with time complexity of O(1), this can be possible by signing each value in an index equal to a number called *hash* that's calculated with different algorithms and the more efficient this algorithm to calculate the hash for each key, the more that hash tree will be.\
Assuming there were two values with the same key, simply we use linked lists to assign values in each index.
