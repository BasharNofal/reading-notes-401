* **Web Server**: It's a server that provides HTTP/HTTPS services or where a website services is provided, so for example if I want to visit a website the web server sends a response with the data needed to my device after sending a request from my side.

* **Express**: It's a node.js framework, it allows rendering HTML pages and setting up requests for the different HTTP requests.

* **Routing**: The process of redirecting a request to the corresponding destination/output.

* **WRRC**: It's a blueprint describes the way that a backend server deals with different http requests/responses and where it redirects each request and response. (I forgot what it stands for :/).
