# Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Access controls limits the permissions given to certain users so, not every one can access all the data that's available on the database/website.

2. Online schools, where the instructors have access to all students data, grading logs, and many other things whereas the students can't access all logs or change data related to the courses.

3. To split the website visitors so each role is given set of rules, policies, and accessability.

4. In discretionary access control: permissions are set by the resource owner, so for example if you make a file your the owner and have full control over it, whereas in role based access list rules and policies are set by the admin of the website.

### Terms

**Authorization:** giving permission to access data based on some criteria or applying set of rules the controls the access of something.

**Role Based Access Control:** rules and policies that controls the access of data based on roles of websites visitors.

**Capabilities:** the things that visitors can do in a website.


## Preview

**Event:** It's basically similar *eventListener* in vanilla javaScript, but in node.js we require event module then make instance of the EventEmitter() class then we are good to go.
