# Graphs

**Graph:** is a non-linear data structure which as is a collection of nodes that's connected together by lines called edges.

## Terms used in graphs

**Vertex:** another name for node.
**Neighbor:** nodes that are connected by edge.
**Degree:** number of edges connected to a node.

### Directed vs Undirected

**Directed** graphs where edges have a certain direction.
**Undirected** graphs where edges don't have a certain direction (bi-directional).

### Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

**Complete:** where all nodes in the graphs are connected together.
**Connected:** where each node is connected to at least one node.
**Disconnected:** at least one node is not connected to any node.

### Acyclic vs Cyclic

**Acyclic:** when you traverse through a graph and the start point is not the same as the end point.
**Cyclic:** when you traverse through a graph and the start point is the same as the end point.

### Graph Representation

Graphs can be represented by either **Adjacency Matrix** or **Adjacency List**.
