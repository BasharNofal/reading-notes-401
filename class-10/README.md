# Stacks and Queues

**Stack:** is a data structure similar to linked lists, set of nodes every node refers to next one.

There are some parameters in stack: 

* **Push** add node to the stack.
* **Pop** remove node from the stack.
* **Top** the node at top of the stack.
* **Peek** the value of the top node.
* **IsEmpty** returns true if the call stack is empty.

In stack the first node added to the stack is the last one to come out (FILO: first in last out) and vise versa.

Push and pop in stack is similar to linked list, you need to change the where the new node refers to if you are adding to the top of the stack and change where the node at the bottom refers to when you are adding a node to the bottom.
