# Trees

**Trees** are non-linear data structure which are basically collection of nodes linked together to simulate a hierarchy, each node refers to its children nodes. The node at the top is called *root*, the nodes which have the same parent are called *siblings*, the nodes which don't have children are called leaves.

**Binary Trees** are trees which its nodes have at most two children, in binary trees nodes have three fields, one to store data, and two to refer to their children.
